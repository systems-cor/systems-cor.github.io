## Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems Group

[website](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/)

PDOS builds high-performance, reliable, and working systems in many domains.

We mostly publish in SOSP and OSDI (see our [publications list](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/publications/)).

Our group meetings are Tuesdays at 4pm in G925. Contact Tej Chajed <tchajed@mit.edu> to schedule something, if you'd like to give a practice talk or present something and get feedback from the group.
